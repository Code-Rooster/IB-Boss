Hey Mr. Glenn!
Welcome to my project! (Sort of)
This is essentially the game in it's most barebones state.
It has the movement (Which is a little clunky),
A robust dialogue system (With effects like <j>jitter,<j> <w>wave,<w> and <R>all<R> <K>sorts<K> <M>of<M> <C>colors.<C>)
And a lock and key system (Which I couldn't find a use for in this little demo).
Now I need to make more art, finish designing the first floor of the mansion, create a combat system, make the first boss, and compose a bunch of music!
You'll find a chest waiting on the other side of this room for ya'!
Thanks for being my advisor!
