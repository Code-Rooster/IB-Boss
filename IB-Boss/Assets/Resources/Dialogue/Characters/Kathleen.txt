Ok! Well let's get started, then!
To move around, use the <K>WASD keys,<K> or the <K>arrow keys.<K>
Whichever you prefer.
That bar near the top left of the screen? That's your <K>Boost Meter.<K>
Pressing the <K>Space Bar<K> will activate your <M>Boost,<M> which will propel you forward in the direction you're moving.
Holding down the <K>Left or Right Mouse Buttons<K> while near an object will cause it to rotate around you.
The direction it rotates depends on which button you push.
Only <K>object that are highlighted<K> are able to be picked up this way.
Feel free to mess around in this room for a little while!
When you feel comfortable enough, go ahead and go through into the door at the back of the room.
Good luck!
You're gonna need it.
